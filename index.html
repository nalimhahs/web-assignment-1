                Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I am a full stack web developer having almost three years of experience designing, building, testing and maintaining websites, both the front end as well as the backend, in various technologies, integrating and developing various APIs as
                well as deployment to various platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                I master in creating beautiful interfaces in ReactJS and backing them up with well designed APIs made with Django Rest Framework. I am quite versed in deploying the applications to platforms like Heroku, Netlify and Firebase as well on server instances
                on AWS and GCP. I also have experience with developing UI/UX mockups with animations using tools like Adobe XD, Invision Studio and Figma.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also am a regular participant in CTFs both online as well as offline which provide me with an solid grasp of web security. Building functional yet easy to use UIs and interfaces are a passion of mine. In addition to this, I constantly update myself
                with the changing tech landscape which include both JavaScript Frameworks as well as new languages and technologies.
            </p>
